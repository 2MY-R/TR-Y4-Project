    "I met with my supervisor, Ashley, and the rest of my research group. We discussed a possible direction for the project: developing a generic AI algorithm to predict biological events. I will use a mix of amoeba yeast and macrophage-bacteria footage to train my model. We have set up a regular weekly meeting slot to keep track of work. We have an additional meeting planned for next week to lay out a more detailed project plan and begin discussing the risk assessment due for W4. For the rest of this week, I will train and run a Detectron2 segmentation model and a feature extraction algorithm on an amoeba-yeast dataset.\n"
